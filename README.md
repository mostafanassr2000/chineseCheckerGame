-Programming Language Used: Java


-Instructions To Run: Open the GUI.java from the project and run it or RUN THE JAR FILE (chineseCheckerGame.jar)

-IDE used: Visual Studio Code

-Heuristic Function: 1- First we iterate through the player(cpu or human) vertices which is not NULL
                     
                     2- Then we add them in an arraylist

                     3- Then we loop through the arraylist and we calculate the sum of the equlidean distances between each vertex in the arraylist and the goal 
                        which we pass to the heuristic function

                     4- then return the sum and choose the vertex move which will minimize this sum (having the maximum distance).
